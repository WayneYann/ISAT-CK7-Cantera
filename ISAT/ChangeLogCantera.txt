Change log; replacing Chemkin with Cantera

All subroutines in cklib_stub were made functional using Cantera.
Names were changed from CK* to CT*, and the routine's arguments were
adapted (basically removal of Chemkin work spaces). Then it was renamed
to canteralib (and compiles to ctlib.a (.so))

A new variable was created in module ci_dat6; type(phase_t) :: gas
which is a Cantera gas object. The gas object can be given different
thermodynamic states, and be used to retrieve thermodynamic quantities
using the interfaces in cantera.f (from cantera source)

All references to Chemkin's work space (iwk, rwk, cwk) have been removed.
subroutine ck_thermo used to read in the NASA polynomal coefficients directly
from the Chemkin work space. With Cantera, a new C++ interface routine was
created to provide the same data. (canteraaccess.cpp)

subroutine ck_corr was removed as it had a similar dependency on Chemkin.
Cantera can correct data by itself.

The subroutines in ice-pic/g_jacadf.f rely heavily on Chemkin's internal work
arrays, and has been removed, by excluding the file in SOURCES.mk Along with
them, the two subroutines "jacobian" and "cijac5adf" in isat-ck was commented 
out. This means certain functionality of ice-pic and isat-ck is not available 
currently. This also means that the programs PaSR and isatab_test does not 
compile.

During installation of Cantera, the library "libcantera_fortran.a" was 
created. This library has to be present in ISAT_dependencies/lib, 
typically as a symbolic link to the Cantera installation:

    $ ls -l ISAT_dependencies/lib
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 kalle kalle 35 jan 16 13:23 libcantera_fortran.a -> /usr/local/lib/libcantera_fortran.a

Further, Cantera has to be compiled with the flag -fPIC. Edit the SConstruct file.

Before building, edit build-files/vars.mk and set the Cantera files path
correctly.

Windows: I have not tried building this on Windows. There should probably
be changes to the build files to do this!
